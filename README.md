Implementation of different Algorithms

## Triplets.py
This was an (imperfect) Algorithm that was developed from scratch for a codewars kata. The algorithm is fully original, with a complicated and unique flow. It showcases creativity in problem solving. 

The original solution for the triplet problem is Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting.
